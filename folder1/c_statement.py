#Conditional statement :-
#=> A conditional statement is used to perform different actions based on whether a certain condition is true or false. It typically involves.

#Two conditions :- if , else

#if "Rohit reached the class on time":
#    print("Rohit will attend the class")
#else:
 #  print("Rohit will not attend the class")NOTE: ":" colon  =>  it is used to define the body of any statement in python.
a = 40
b = 30
if a > b:  
         print("a is greater than b")
         print("it is code for if block")
         print("another statement in if block") 
else:
    print("b is greater than a")
    print("it is code for else block")
    print("another statement in else block")
    print("hii, guys, this is out of if else block")


 #   Notes : in python we use colon : to define the body of if and else, any loop 
#-> In c language :- in any statement we use curly braces { } to define the body of  if and else,  any loop.
#-> Semicolon is used to terminate any statement in c language.
if (a > b)
{ 
   printf("a is greater than b");
   print("it is code for if block");
   print("another statement in if block");
}
else
{
  printf("b is greater than a");
  print("it is code for else block");
}
print("Indentation in python")

#Notes : Indentation is very important in python.
# => backbone of python 

if: #condition is true       
   print("it will print this line of code  this")
else:
   print("it will print this line of code  that")




#— User Input / Check Condition
num = int(input("Enter any number: "))
if num == 99:
    print("you have entered 99")
else:
    print("you have not entered 99")
